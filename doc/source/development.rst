How do I contribute a new query?
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
We will have a function in this API executable to generate a new data structure for adding to `nidm-query <https://github.com/incf-nidash/nidm-query>`_. This will work via command line, or via a web interface for you to input fields for your structure. We recommend that you use the generation functions to ensure accuracy in the format and fields of your data structure. You can then add it to the repo by submitting a pull request to add it. A pull request affords group discussion, and we will eventually have continuous integration that will run tests on your new query.
